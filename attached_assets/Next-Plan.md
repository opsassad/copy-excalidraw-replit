You‚Äôve now implemented nearly all the core features and UX polish found in professional tools like Excalidraw! Here‚Äôs a summary of what‚Äôs done and what you might consider next for a truly comprehensive, production-grade drawing app:

---

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- **Robust selection, movement, and resizing** for all element types (including multi-select and proportional group resize).
- **Context-aware property panel** (only relevant controls for each type).
- **Undo/redo** with backend sync.
- **Point handles for lines/arrows/draw** and resize handles for shapes.
- **Keyboard shortcuts and toolbar UX.**

---

## üöÄ Next-Level Features & Polish

### 1. **Export/Import**
- Export to PNG, SVG, and JSON (with all properties preserved).
- Import from JSON (restore a full drawing).

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Test with 100+ elements: is the canvas still smooth?
- Consider batching updates or using virtualization for very large drawings.

### 3. **Grouping/Ungrouping**
- Allow users to group elements (move/resize as a unit) and ungroup them.

### 4. **Layering (Z-Order)**
- Bring forward/send backward, move to front/back.
- Visual layer panel (optional).

### 5. **Snap to Grid/Guides**
- Snap elements to grid or alignment guides for pixel-perfect layouts.

### 6. **Advanced Styling**
- Dashed/dotted lines, arrowhead styles, opacity, shadows, etc.

### 7. **Collaboration**
- Real-time multi-user editing (if desired).

### 8. **Accessibility & Mobile UX**
- Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, touch gestures.

### 9. **Testing & Error Handling**
- Add tests for all core interactions.
- Graceful error messages for backend/network issues.

## What Would You Like Next?
- I can help you implement any of the above, or do a focused audit on a specific area (e.g., export/import, performance, grouping, etc.).
- Or, if you have a feature in mind, just let me know!

**What‚Äôs your next priority?**  
Just say ‚Äúexport/import‚Äù, ‚Äúperformance‚Äù, ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù, ‚Äúlayers‚Äù, or describe your desired feature!






## New Features 2025:


Ran tool
Here‚Äôs a plan for your project, based on the most advanced features in online whiteboard and drawing tools for 2025, as seen in leading products like Boardmix, Miro, and Microsoft Whiteboard:

---

## 2025 Whiteboard/Drawing Tool Feature Plan

### 1. **AI-Powered Assistance**
- **Smart Shape Recognition:** Instantly convert rough sketches into precise shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, etc.).
- **AI Auto-Colorization:** Let users auto-fill and colorize their line drawings with AI, offering style/model choices (e.g., product, anime, layered).
- **AI Suggestions:** As users draw, suggest improvements, alternative layouts, or next steps (e.g., ‚ÄúWould you like to turn this into a flowchart?‚Äù).

### 2. **Real-Time Collaboration**
- **Multi-User Editing:** Multiple users can draw, move, and edit elements simultaneously with live cursors.
- **Commenting & Reactions:** Add sticky notes, comments, and emoji reactions to any element.
- **Presence Indicators:** Show who is viewing or editing the board in real time.

### 3. **Enhanced Drawing Tools**
- **Infinite Canvas:** Pan and zoom across an unlimited workspace.
- **Pen, Brush, Highlighter:** Multiple tool types with adjustable thickness, opacity, and color.
- **Ruler & Guides:** Draw straight lines and align objects precisely.
- **Snap to Grid/Guides:** Elements snap to gridlines or other objects for perfect alignment.

### 4. **Advanced Export & Import**
- **Export Formats:** PNG, SVG, PDF, and JSON (for re-import).
- **Import:** Drag-and-drop images, SVGs, or JSON files to add to the canvas.
- **AI-Enhanced Export:** Option to ‚Äúbeautify‚Äù or ‚Äúvectorize‚Äù hand-drawn sketches on export.

### 5. **Templates & Smart Objects**
- **Template Library:** Ready-made templates for flowcharts, mind maps, business canvases, etc.
- **Smart Objects:** Pre-built objects (e.g., sticky notes, connectors, tables) that can be easily added and edited.

### 6. **Accessibility & UX**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Full keyboard navigation and shortcuts for all actions.
- **Screen Reader Support:** ARIA labels and accessible navigation.
- **Touch & Stylus Optimization:** Smooth drawing and gestures on tablets and touchscreens.

### 7. **Security & Privacy**
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Secure all board data in transit and at rest.
- **Role-Based Access:** Set permissions for viewers, editors, and admins.
- **Audit Logs:** Track changes and user actions for compliance.

### 8. **Cloud & Integration**
- **Cloud Sync:** Boards are saved in the cloud and accessible from any device.
- **Integrations:** Connect with Slack, Google Drive, Zoom, and other productivity tools.

### 9. **AI-Driven Brainstorming & Mind Mapping**
- **AI Mind Map Generator:** Turn a list of ideas into a structured mind map.
- **AI Flowchart Generator:** Convert text instructions into flowcharts automatically.

### 10. **Customization & Branding**
- **Custom Themes:** Allow users to choose or create color themes and fonts.
- **Branding:** Add company logos, custom backgrounds, and watermarks.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit Current Features:**  
   Review your current codebase to see which of these features are already present or partially implemented.

2. **Prioritize Roadmap:**  
   Decide which features are most important for your users and feasible for your team (e.g., start with AI shape recognition and real-time collaboration).

3. **Design & UX Planning:**  
   For each new feature, design a user flow and UI mockup, keeping 1000% focus on UX/UI preciseness as per your rules.

4. **Implementation:**  
   - Start with foundational features (infinite canvas, real-time collaboration).
   - Layer on AI-powered features and advanced export/import.
   - Continuously test for accessibility, security, and performance.

5. **Testing & Feedback:**  
   - Conduct user testing for each major feature.
   - Gather feedback and iterate on UX.

**Execution Status:**  
- I have researched the latest 2025 features in online whiteboard/drawing tools.
- I have synthesized a comprehensive, forward-looking feature plan.
- Next, I recommend auditing your current codebase to map out which of these features are already present and which need to be built.

Would you like to proceed with a feature audit of your current codebase, or focus on a specific feature from this list?
