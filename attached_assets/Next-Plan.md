You‚Äôve now implemented nearly all the core features and UX polish found in professional tools like Excalidraw! Here‚Äôs a summary of what‚Äôs done and what you might consider next for a truly comprehensive, production-grade drawing app:

---

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- **Robust selection, movement, and resizing** for all element types (including multi-select and proportional group resize).
- **Context-aware property panel** (only relevant controls for each type).
- **Undo/redo** with backend sync.
- **Point handles for lines/arrows/draw** and resize handles for shapes.
- **Keyboard shortcuts and toolbar UX.**

---

## üöÄ Next-Level Features & Polish

### 1. **Export/Import**
- Export to PNG, SVG, and JSON (with all properties preserved).
- Import from JSON (restore a full drawing).

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Test with 100+ elements: is the canvas still smooth?
- Consider batching updates or using virtualization for very large drawings.

### 3. **Grouping/Ungrouping**
- Allow users to group elements (move/resize as a unit) and ungroup them.

### 4. **Layering (Z-Order)**
- Bring forward/send backward, move to front/back.
- Visual layer panel (optional).

### 5. **Snap to Grid/Guides**
- Snap elements to grid or alignment guides for pixel-perfect layouts.

### 6. **Advanced Styling**
- Dashed/dotted lines, arrowhead styles, opacity, shadows, etc.

### 7. **Collaboration**
- Real-time multi-user editing (if desired).

### 8. **Accessibility & Mobile UX**
- Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, touch gestures.

### 9. **Testing & Error Handling**
- Add tests for all core interactions.
- Graceful error messages for backend/network issues.

## What Would You Like Next?
- I can help you implement any of the above, or do a focused audit on a specific area (e.g., export/import, performance, grouping, etc.).
- Or, if you have a feature in mind, just let me know!

**What‚Äôs your next priority?**  
Just say ‚Äúexport/import‚Äù, ‚Äúperformance‚Äù, ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù, ‚Äúlayers‚Äù, or describe your desired feature!
